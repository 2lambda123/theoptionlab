1) Data. We use EOD data from the CBOE 

2) Python. We use version 2.7 and recommend Annaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/ 
3) Installed dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt 

4) mysql: https://www.mysql.com/
5) database and tables with script in create_db.sql

6) adapt private/settings_template.py with your own settings and rename the file into settings.py

7) try to run insert_fullday.py and then free_money_scanner.py 

8) And then you are ready to insert all the data and precompute the greeks! 

9) Once the data is in place, run your first backtest with call_backtests.py
