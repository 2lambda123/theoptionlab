	<h1>The Bull</h1>

	<p>
	  "The Bull" is a 30 points wide bull put credit spread for a minimum of $2.50. The guidelines
	  are explained <a href="https://www.lockeinyoursuccess.com/more/the-bull-trade/">here</a>.

	<h2>Guidelines</h2>

	<b>Underlying:</b> ^RUT
	<br />
	<br />

	<b>Entry: </b><br />
	A new trade is entered every month, on the date closest to the specified DTE.<br />

	<ul>
	  <li>65 DTE</li>
	  <li>1 short put closest to delta 10</li>
	  <li>1 long put 30 points below</li>
	  <li>Minimum credit of $2.50</li>
	</ul>

	<b>Exit</b>
	<br />
	<ul>
	  <li>37 or 30 DTE; when the back expiration is at 65 DTE</li>
	  <li>Stop Loss: when credit doubled</li>
	  </ls>

	  We tested several take profit and stop loss settings:

	  <ul>
	    <li><b>P</b> - "Profit": Take Profit at 50% or 80% of credit, and X (none)</li>
	    <li><b>L</b> - "Loss": Stop Loss at 2x or 4x credit, and X (none)</li>
	  </ul>

	  The original version is P_L_200, without take profit and when the
	  credit doubled.
