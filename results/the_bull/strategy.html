		"The Bull" is a public trading strategy of John Locke. The guidelines
		are explained <a

	</p>


	<h2>Guidelines</h2>

	<b>Underlying:</b> ^RUT
	<br />
	<br />

	<b>Entry: 30 points wide bull put credit spread for a minimum of $2.5</b>
	<br />

	<ul>
		<li>65 dte</li>
		<li>1 short put closest to delta 10</li>
		<li>1 long put 30 points below</li>
	</ul>

	<b>Exit</b>
	<br />
	<ol>
		<li>37 or 30 dte; when the back expiration is at 65 dte</li>
		<li>SL: when credit doubled</li>
	</ol>

	We first tested several take profit (TP) and stop loss (SL) criteria,
	with the following values:

	<ul>
		<li>TP: 50% or 80% of credit, and X (disabled)</li>
		<li>SL: 2x and 4x credit, and X (disabled)</li>
	</ul>

	The original version is P_X_L_200, without take profit and when the
	credit doubled.
